/**
   A **ThingMap** is an unordered map of things with case-sensitive names. Things are expected to be unique, but the class will not provide feedback if not - it will just ignore it. It is up to the managing class to provide unique things.
 
   It provides methods for getting case-insensitive things, but the class itself is case-sensitive.

   - Outside: Methods to manage things, accessors to properties.
   - Inside: Directly manages things and manages each Thing by calling its methods.
